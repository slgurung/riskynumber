        <blockquote>RiskyNumber is a web platform for financial information analytics, primarily for the stock
        market data. This is not a commercial product. This platform is being developed for personal
        education & research purposes only. At the moment, this platform is in it's very
        early stages of development.<br><br>
        The majority of information is derived from the various websites using APIs and web-scraping
        technologies based on Python. I can't gaurantee the accuracy of financial data and other
        information you find in this platform. I don't recommend to buy or sell any of the stocks you
        may find in this website. I don't have any investment relationship with any of these companies.
        In the future, the financial data and information might be imported to this app from a reliable
        commercial sources if it is feasible. Until then, this is just an ongoing personal research project.
        <br><br>
        I would like to thank to all the providers of open source technologies, free APIs, tutorials,
        and all other tools which made this project possible. I hope this app becomes a useful source
        for the investors as it matures in future. Please visit the platform more frequently for the updates.
        Thank you for your visit.<br><br>
        Surya Gurung.
